Priority:
 1. Clean up database calls
 2. Language support
 3. Fix CSS
 4. Member Pictures
 


= Fix CSS

= Language support
  - Create a DOM element to keep active language
  - or pass it via GET requests

= Clean up database calls
  - create generic functions
  - gather all sample name declarations in main class
  - generic functions should accept language parameter to choose correct string
  - security testing

= Member pictures
  - currently only available through gravatar
  - upload in member profile


= Automation
  - Research reports of the institute
  - Create Institute Poster (photos and members, titles, positions)
 
= Member’s blog
  - Each member can have blog posts in their personal page.
  - Connect the author id of a post with the user_id of the member and show posts

= News
  - blog posts in front page.
  - Custom Post Type: news

= Open positions page
  - Create the template
  - connect to google forms? Have a WP form plugin to submit things? Create custom?
  - Custom Post Type: open_position

= Project
  - display at the bottom the open_position posts related to the project

== Ajaxify everything
  - It should be a single page app
  - The content (everything except header and footer) is served via Ajax
  - This will help with language changes
  - It is important for mobile devices
  - reduce the number of DB calls
